title: "Landslide identification using machine learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/202002
excerpt: 'Highlights:<br>1. Landslide identification is critical for risk assessment and mitigation.<br>2. A novel integrated machine-learning and deep-learning method is proposed to identify natural-terrain landslides.<br> 3. Multiple machine learning and deep learning models are trained and evaluated on three landslide databases.<br> 4. A case study in Lantau, Hong Kong, is worked out, achieving an identification accuracy of 92.5%. <br> The deep convolutional neural network model is found to be the most promising for landslide identification.'
