  <img src="/images/reserach%20overview.png">
  <br />  <br />
My current research focuses on the investigation of rain- and earthquake-induced landslides using artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing (RS) techniques, as well as developing machine learning-based solutions for snow/glacier analyses. My research area mainly covers Hong Kong and the Tibetan Plateau.

  <br />
My ongoing research projects encompass three fields: (a) AI-powered landslide identification, hazard assessment and forecasting, (b) Machine learning-based automated snow/glacier mapping   and temporal evolution analysis, and (c) Experimental investigations on hydrophobic (water repellent) soils.
