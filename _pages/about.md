Hi, there. Welcome to my homepage. I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Education
======
Ph.D.	The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong	2020
B.Eng.	China University of Geosciences, Wuhan	2016

Research interests
======
My research focuses on the integration of landslide research with state-of-art artificial intelligence techniques, real-time slope reliability analysis using monitoring information and the applications of Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for landslide studies.
My current research interests and ongoing research projects encompass two fields: 1) AI powered landslide identification, susceptibility assessment and forecasting and 2) Dynamic landslide reliability analysis using monitoring and remote sensing data.

Recent updates
