<h1>Hi, there!</h1>
Welcome to my personal website. I am Haojie Wang (王昊杰), currently a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.ce.ust.hk/">Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering</a> of <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/">The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>, working with <a href="https://www.ce.ust.hk/people/limin-zhang-zhanglimin">Prof. Limin Zhang</a>.

Research interests
======
<div align="justify">
My current research focuses on the investigation of rain- and earthquake-induced landslides using artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing (RS) techniques, as well as developing machine learning-based solutions for snow/glacier analyses. My research area mainly covers the entire Hong Kong and the eastern Tibetan Plateau.

</div>
<div align="justify">
My ongoing research projects encompass three fields: (a) AI-powered landslide identification, hazard assessment and forecasting, (b) Machine learning-based automated snow/glacier mapping   and temporal evolution analysis, and (c) Experimental investigations on hydrophobic (water repellent) soil.
