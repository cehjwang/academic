Education
======
* Ph.D in Civil Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 2020
* B.Eng. in Civil Engineering, China University of Geosciences, 2016

Research interests
======
<div align="justify">
My research focuses on the integration of landslide research with state-of-art artificial intelligence techniques, real-time slope reliability analysis using monitoring information and the applications of Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for landslide studies.  
My current research interests and ongoing research projects encompass two fields: 1) AI powered landslide identification, susceptibility assessment and forecasting and 2) Dynamic landslide reliability analysis using monitoring and remote sensing data.
