<h1>Hi, there!</h1>
Welcome to my personal website. I am Haojie Wang (王昊杰), currently a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.ce.ust.hk/">Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering</a> of <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/">The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>, working with <a href="https://www.ce.ust.hk/people/limin-zhang-zhanglimin">Professor Limin Zhang</a>.

<div align="left">
<img src="/images/reserach%20overview.png" width="405" height="352" style="float:left">
My current research focuses on the investigation of natural hazards (e.g., rain- and earthquake-induced landslides) and snow/glacier evolution under climate change using artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing (RS) techniques.
</div>
<div align="left">
<br/>
I am particularly interested in developing AI-based solutions to address sustainable development challenges in (a) landslide risk assessment, early warning and forecasting for sustainable cities and communities, (b) intelligent earth observation for improving population health and supporting policy making, (c) snow/glacier mapping and temporal evolution under global warming, (d) innovative geo-materials for sustainable development.
