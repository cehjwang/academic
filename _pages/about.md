Research interests
======
<div align="justify">
My research focuses on the investigation of rain- and earthquake-induced landslides using artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing techniques, the analysis of real-time slope reliability using multi-source monitoring information, as well as developing machine learning-based solutions for snow/glacier analyses. My research area mainly covers the entire Hong Kong and the Tibetan Plateau.

<div align="justify">
My current research interests and ongoing research projects encompass three fields: 1) AI-powered landslide identification, susceptibility assessment and forecasting, 2) ML-based automated snow/glacier mapping and evolution analysis, and 3) Dynamic landslide reliability analysis using monitoring and remote sensing data.
